# Admin Dashboard Migration Documentation

## Architecture Decisions

1. Role-Based Component Structure
- Implemented modular folder structure with role-specific components
- Each role has its own routes, components, services, and models
- Shared components and services in `admin/shared` directory

2. Authorization Strategy
- Created `AuthorizationService` for centralized permission management
- Role Guard implementation for route protection
- Permission-based UI rendering in components
- Hierarchical role structure with inheritance

3. Component Design
- Using standalone components for better tree-shaking
- Shared components for common UI elements (data tables, forms, etc.)
- Role-specific components for specialized functionality
- Mobile-responsive layout with collapsible sidebar

4. State Management
- Using BehaviorSubject for local state management
- Services maintain their own state with observables
- Component-level state for UI interactions
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## API Contracts

1. Authentication Endpoints
```typescript
POST /api/auth/login
Request: { email: string; password: string }
Response: { token: string; user: User }

POST /api/auth/refresh
Request: { refreshToken: string }
Response: { token: string }
```

2. Role Management Endpoints
```typescript
GET /api/admin/roles
Query: { page: number; limit: number; search?: string }
Response: { data: Role[]; total: number }

POST /api/admin/roles
Request: { name: string; description: string; permissions: string[] }
Response: Role

PUT /api/admin/roles/:id
Request: { name?: string; description?: string; permissions?: string[] }
Response: Role

DELETE /api/admin/roles/:id
Response: void
```

3. User Management Endpoints
```typescript
GET /api/admin/users
Query: { page: number; limit: number; search?: string; role?: string }
Response: { data: User[]; total: number }

POST /api/admin/users
Request: { email: string; password: string; role: string; ... }
Response: User

PUT /api/admin/users/:id
Request: { email?: string; role?: string; ... }
Response: User

DELETE /api/admin/users/:id
Response: void
```
